            <h3>Early life and education</h3>
            <p>Chadwick Aaron Boseman was born and raised in Anderson, South Carolina, the son of Carolyn (n√©e
            Mattress) and Leroy Boseman, both African-American. His mother was a nurse, and his father worked at a
            textile factory and managed an upholstery business. In his youth, Boseman practiced martial arts, and continued
            this training as an adult. As a child, he wanted to become an architect. According to Boseman, DNA testing
            indicated that some of his ancestors were Krio people and Limba people from Sierra Leone, and Yoruba people from
            Nigeria.
            Boseman graduated from T. L. Hanna High School in 1995 where he played on the basketball team. In his junior
            year, he wrote his first play, Crossroads, and staged it at the school after a classmate was shot and killed. He
            competed in Speech and Debate in the National Speech and Debate Association at T. L. Hanna. He placed eighth in Original
            Oratory at the 1995 National Tournament. He was recruited to play basketball at college but chose the arts
            instead, attending college at Howard University in Washington, D.C. and graduating in 2000 with a Bachelor of Fine
            Arts in directing. While at Howard, he worked in an African-American oriented bookstore near the university, which
            friend Vanessa German said was important and inspirational to him; he drew on his experience there for his play
            Hieroglyphic Graffiti. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chadwick_Boseman#Early_life_and_education">Click to continue..</a></p>
            <h3>Career</h3>
            <p>Boseman lived in Brooklyn, New York City, at the start of his career. In 2000, he was named a Drama League Directing
            Fellow. He directed productions including George C. Wolfe's The Colored Museum (Wolfe would later direct Boseman
            in his final role) and a staging of Amiri Baraka's Dutchman. He worked as the drama instructor in the Schomburg
            Junior Scholars Program, housed at the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture in Harlem between 2002 and
            2009.
            He rose to prominence as a playwright and stage actor in 2002, performing in multiple productions and winning an AUDELCO
            award in 2002 for his part in Ron Milner's Urban Transitions. As a member of the National Shakespeare Company of New
            York, he played Romeo in Romeo and Juliet and Malcolm in Macbeth. He directed and wrote plays as part of the
            Hip-hop theater movement; his works included Rhyme Deferred (co-written with Howard classmate Kamilah Forbes), in which
            he also performed, and Hieroglyphic Graffiti. Rhyme Deferred was commissioned for a national tour, as
            well as featuring in The Fire This Time anthology of works, while Hieroglyphic Graffiti was produced at a variety of
            locations, including the National Black Theatre Festival in 2001. Combining modern African-American culture and
            Egyptian deities, it is set in Washington, D.C. and was picked up by the New York Hip-Hop Theatre Festival and Tennessee
            State University's summer stock theatre program in 2002. It was also the Kuntu Repertory Theatre's 2002-03 season
            launch production. At the 2002 Hip-Hop Theatre Festival, Boseman also gave a one-man show called "Red Clay and Carved
            Concrete". <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chadwick_Boseman#Career">More</a></p>
